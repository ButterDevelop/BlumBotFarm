# Blum Bot Farm

I made this farm just for fun in 24 hours.

It works on requests and does not require expensive maintenance.

The program supports the ability to use a proxy and User Agent for a specific account.

All features are collection of daily rewards and automatic play for all accounts.

The administration goes through the Telegram bot.

Perhaps the ability to collect tasks will be added, as well as, less likely, collecting rewards from referrals.

Referrals increase the chance of a ban, so perhaps itâ€™s not worth it, anyway the limit is only on 10 invitations.

I think that the farm is unlikely to be found and banned by the developers.
